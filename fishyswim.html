			<h3>What happens?</h3>
			<p>You play as a research scientist on an underwater submarine around the year 2050. Your team is researching deep sea creatures. Out of nowhere Fishy will bite a huge hole in the side of the submarine, killing everyone onboard except you. Stranded in the deep sea you will have to find metal scraps to repair the submarine, while also finding resources to sustain yourself.</p>

			<h3>Fishy</h3>
			<p><a href="3d.html" id="tex">See and download the 3D Model (does not include mouth)</a></p>
			<p>The fishy 3D model is a recreation of <a id="tex" href="https://www.deviantart.com/d4rkharlequin/art/Fishy-170783017">this artwork</a> and was made using Blender. Fishy has a concealed mouth and the visible humanoid mouth is fake, this hidden mouth is as wide as his body and has massive sharp teeth.</p>

				  <p align="left">Fishy is a deep sea creature that lives in a cave. He is very territorial and will attack any object that comes close to his home, such as submarines. Fishy is alone in the sea, he is a mutation of another deep sea creature. This uniqueness makes him of great interest to scientists.</p>
				  <p align="left">To reproduce, Fishy will make a low pitched clicking sound, about 10 clicks per second. This sound can be replicated by a human by breathing in and restricting the vocal cords. Using this method, Fishy can attract females of the species he has mutated from. This species can provide sustenance to offspring from both male and female fish using concealed teats on the underside.</p>

			<h3>Submarine</h3>
		  <p>The submarine is built solely for research and contains a large laboratoy on the upper floor. Below this are living quaters for the scientists to sleep. &nbsp;Cameras are mounted on the outside of the vessel to allow the pilot to see a 360 degree view of the ocean floor through large screens in the driving room. In this area is a radar which can be detatched from the instrument panel and carried around.</p>
			<p>Mounted on the front are four large spotlights that are very bright and light up the way. The colour scheme of the submarine is white and black with orange detail lines. At the back, it has a massive propulsion device and large fins to direct it up and down.</p>
